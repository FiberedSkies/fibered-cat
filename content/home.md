## hullo!!
My name is sushi <3

I'm a systems tinkerer, love all things autonomous systems theory and systems programming. I mainly work in Rust, Solidity, C/C++, and Python. 

I believe in free and open source software as a means of resisting digital oppression, data privacy as a default digital right, and access to secure self-hosted tech as a necessity to maintain digital sovereignty.

### FOSS 

I'm a member of [Mesocarp](https://github.com/TheMesocarp/), a FOSS cybernetics R&D collective, where I build tools for complex systems research in my free time. Some of the more interesting libraries I've made are the following:

- [aika](https://github.com/TheMesocarp/aika): A high-performance multi-agent coordination framework, with single and multi-threaded execution, as well as direct support for multi-socket systems. Built entirely on atomic messaging, without using any async/await runtimes or locks. (WIP)
- [koho](https://github.com/TheMesocarp/koho): A *Hodge Neural Network* library in Rust. Extends typical sheaf diffusion to function over a fixed cell dimension within a given cell complex. Uses the full Hodge laplacian over the cellular sheaf, and built on a `candle-core` backend. v0.1.0 published on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/koho).
- [mesocarp](https://github.com/TheMesocarp/mesocarp): High-performance lock-free primitives for multi-threaded communications, scheduling, and logging. Forms the backbone for `aika`. v0.10.0 published on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/mesocarp).

### Cool People

#### [Riley](https://jtriley.com/)

Probably the best engineer I've ever met, has inspired and taught me so much. If you have a high performance system that's already doing great, chances are they still know how to optimize it further. Best person to just talk to for hours about everything from systems design to social dynamics and emergence. 

#### [Ada](https://x.com/adalovescoffeee/)

An algebraic number theorist whos walking the path to becoming an incredible engineer. Is working on some of the coolest computational math projects in Julia. Huge sweetheart who doesn't seem to realize the power he yields. My fav person to just talk about music, math, and life with.

#### [Saturday](https://x.com/skitterspatial/)

An algebraic geometer with a love for the applied. My co-captain, and I'd like to think mentor, in our explorations of systems theory through sheaves, stacks, and operads. One of the most fun and playful people I've had the pleasure of working with! 

#### [Sam](https://samlaki.neocities.org/)

Logician, Mathematician, Engineer and probably like five other things. If you have a ridiculous idea you want to build, whether its software, hardware, or an extremely specific analog device, he can probably give exactly the right advice or nudge that you need to make it real.
