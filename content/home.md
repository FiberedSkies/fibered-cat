# hello, friend :)
My name is sushi <3

I'm a systems tinkerer, love all things autonomous systems theory and systems programming. I mainly work in Rust, Python, and C/C++ and am trying to learn Lean4 right now. 

I've worked in autonomous systems R&D for 3 years, lately using RL + LLMs in automated evasion agents, multi-objective pathfinders, and companion agents.

I believe in free and open source software as a means of resisting digital oppression, data privacy as a default digital right, and access to secure self-hosted tech as a necessity to maintain digital sovereignty.

### FOSS

I'm a member of [Mesocarp](https://github.com/TheMesocarp/), a FOSS cybernetics research collective, where I work on math, ml libraries, and simulation infrastructure (agent-based, discrete event) in my free time. Some of the more interesting libraries I've made are the following:

- [kala](https://github.com/TheMesocarp/aika): Extremely fast agent-based simulator framework (WIP)
- [koho](https://github.com/TheMesocarp/koho): Sheaf diffusion over a `candle-core` backend. (WIP)
- [categories](https://github.com/TheMesocarp/categories): Computational category theory library. (WIP)

### Cool People

#### [Riley](https://jtriley.com/)

Probably the best engineer I've ever met, has inspired and taught me so much. If you have a high performance system that's already doing great, chances are they still know how to optimize it further. Best person to just talk to for hours about everything from systems design to social dynamics and emergence. 

#### [Ada](https://x.com/adalovescoffeee/)

An algebraic number theorist with an eye for the applied side. Is working on some of the coolest computational math projects in Julia. Huge sweetheart who doesn't seem to realize the power he yields. My fav person to just talk about music, math, and life with.

#### [Saturday](https://x.com/skitterspatial/)

An algebraic geometer with an eye for the applied. My co-captain, and I'd like to think mentor, in our explorations of systems theory through sheaves and stacks. One of the most fun and playful people I've had the pleasure of working with! 

#### [Sam](https://samlaki.neocities.org/)

Logician, Mathematician, Engineer and probably like five other things. If you have a ridiculous idea you want to build, whether its software, hardware, or an extremely specific device, he can probably give exactly the right advice or nudge that you need to make it real.

#### [Jepsen](https://github.com/0xJepsen/)

Jepsen is the applied mathematician and cryptographer who got Colin and I into Rust, and ultimately respecting the computational side of math much more. He's one of the most passionate and authentic people you'll ever meet; and always inspires you to be the best engineer you can be, whether he intends it or not.
