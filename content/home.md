# hello, friend :)
My name is sushi! I'm an HPC engineer and a hobbyist geometer. Welcome to my portal! In [resources](# "data-page=resources") you can find a bunch of resources for the topics I've been curious about lately (learn with me!), and [blurbs](# "data-page=blurbs") is where I mini write-ups on interesting concepts or tools I find during my studies! Find links to my socials on the bottom. I hope you have a pleasant day! ❤️

### OSS Projects

Some open source stuff I've contributed to includes:
