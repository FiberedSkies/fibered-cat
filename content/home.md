# hello, friend :)
My name is sushi! I'm an automation researcher and all around curious cat. Welcome to my portal! In [resources](# "data-page=resources") you can find a bunch of resources for the topics I've been curious about lately, and [blurbs](# "data-page=blurbs") will contain miniature write-ups on interesting tid bits I find during my studies! Find links to my socials on the bottom. I hope you have a pleasant day! ❤️

### OSS Projects

Some open source stuff I've contributed to includes:

- [arbiter](https://github.com/anthias-labs/arbiter): Agent-based simulation framework for Ethereum execution environments.
- [type_sheaf](https://github.com/Autoparallel/type_sheaf): Sheaves of arbitrary types in Rust. WIP

It's my new years resolution for 2025 to make more of an effort this year to do open source work!!
