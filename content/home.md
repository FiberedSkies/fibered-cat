# hello, friend :)
My name is sushi <3

I don't quite know what you'd call me. R&D engineer or something.

In my free time, I research emergence and stability in complex systems.

I do systems programming in Rust and C/C++. I particularly enjoy working on high performance systems, simulators, and ML-based adaptive systems.

I believe in radical open source, open access to knowledge and technology, and symbiotic collaboration. I strongly oppose the plutocracy, and see a unique power in federated research collectives who boast these values, in keeping techocapital power structures in check. I see knowledge enclosure as a form of parasitism on public intellectual labor.

### OSS

Some open source stuff I've contributed to includes:

- [kala](https://github.com/FiberedSkies/kala): Extremely fast agent-based simulator framework, built in Rust. (WIP)
- [koho](https://github.com/FiberedSkies/koho): Spectral analysis of cellular sheaves of arbitrary types, built in Rust (WIP)
- [arbiter](https://github.com/anthias-labs/arbiter): Agent-based Ethereum sandbox, built in Rust.

### Cool People

#### [Riley](https://jtriley.com/)

Probably the best engineer I've ever met, has inspired and taught me so much. If you have a high performance system that's already doing great, chances are they still know how to optimize it further. Best person to just talk to for hours about everything from systems design to social dynamics and emergence. 

#### [Colin](https://autoparallel.xyz/)

I started as his boss and now I feel like he's my mentor. He's a mathematician by training and what I'd call a full-stack researcher, capable of everything from embedded systems programming and HPC to plasma physics research. Is single-handedly responsible for getting our entire circle into sheaves, and has taught us all so much.

#### [Jepsen](https://github.com/0xJepsen/)

Jepsen is the applied math and cryptography wizard responsible for getting Colin and I into Rust, and ultimately respecting the computational side of math much more. He's one of the most passionate, authentic, and kind hearted people you'll ever meet; and always inspires you to be the best engineer you can be, whether he intends it or not.

#### [Ada](https://x.com/adalovescoffeee/)

An algebraic number theorist with an eye for the applied side. Is working on some of the coolest computational math projects in Julia. Huge sweetheart who doesn't seem to realize the power he yields. My fav person to just talk about music, math, and life with.

#### [Sam](https://samlaki.neocities.org/)

Your local digital McGyver. If you have a ridiculous idea you want to build, whether its software, hardware, or an actual device, he can probably give exactly the right advice or nudge that you need to make it real. Probably one of the few people capable of the entire research-to-reality pipeline.

#### [Bug](https://x.com/skitterspatial/)

An algebraic geometer with an eye for the applied. My co-captain, and I'd like to think mentor, in our explorations of systems theory through sheaves and stacks. One of the most fun and playful people I've had the pleasure of working with, with an intuition that borders on x-ray vision.
