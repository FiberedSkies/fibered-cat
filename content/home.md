# hello, friend :)
My name is sushi! I build simulations and RL-based automata. Welcome to my portal! In [resources](# "data-page=resources") you can find a bunch of resources for the topics I've been curious about lately, and [blurbs](# "data-page=blurbs") will contain mini write-ups on interesting tid bits I find during my studies! Find links to my socials on the bottom. I hope you have a pleasant day! ❤️

### OSS Projects

Some open source stuff I've contributed to includes:

- [aika](https://github.com/FiberedSkies/aika): Extremely fast and flexible agent-based parallel simulator, built in Rust.
- [arbiter](https://github.com/anthias-labs/arbiter): Ethereum sandbox simulator with EVM parity, built in Rust.
- [type_sheaf](https://github.com/Autoparallel/type_sheaf): Sheaves of arbitrary types, built in Rust. WIP
