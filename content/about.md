I ask myself this a lot. 

## Personal Bio

I'm an ex-competitive distance runner, though stopped after breaking my ankle a while back. I still love running now, just am not nearly as fast anymore. I crochet a lot, I like making tops and bucket hats. I also bake a ton of desserts (particularly cookies and pies), read a lot of novels, and love RnB. 

Lately have been reading Kurt Vonegut's books! Just finished Cat's Cradle, now reading Slaughterhouse 5.

## Professional Info

Academically, I studied applied math and physics at the University of Waterloo, got a BSc. I've been an autonomous systems R&D engineer for 3 years professionally, lately learning to use RL + LLMs in automated evasion agents, multi-objective pathfinders, and companion agents. My previous position was an ML research internship with AIKOCorp, exploring autonomous EDR evasion agents. Prior to this, I worked on autonomous portfolio replication research for roughly two years. 

I do short-term and/or project-based solo contracts from time to time, so feel free to reach out if you have anything for me!

## Tech Interests

I have way too many to list but here's the list of stuff you'll see me ranting about:

 - **Simulation Design**
 - **Autonomous Systems & Agents**
 - **Unsupervised Learning**
 - **Evasion Developement**
 - **Applied Categories and Topoi**

I have nothing up currently, but will be posting little insights about these topics I find worth sharing under **Blurbs**. I eventually also want to do long forms but we'll start somewhere I suppose.

## contact info

If any of these topics interest you or you want to have a chat, send me an email at [sushi@fibered.cat](mailto:sushi@fibered.cat)! For aiko related inquiries, send me a dm on twitter!
