I ask myself this daily. I'm just a curious cat with too much to learn and too little time in a day! Professionally, I've been an automation researcher for 3 years now working on adversarial systems, and have recently returned to school to finish my degree in mathematical physics at [REDACTED] university. Currently, I'm an intern at [AIKOCorp](https://aikocorp.ai/) building tools for automated evasion. I also like to blurb about computational geometry and adversarial systems sometimes. I probably have way too many curiosities to list, but the following take up most of my free mindshare:

 1. **Algebraic Information Geometry**: Particularly interested in applications of deformation theory and Artin stacks in complex system analytics and machine learning. I got interested in this after seeing the work [NASA](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20220002277/downloads/AeroConf_2022___Sheaves_for_Routing_in_DTN%20--%202022-02-25.pdf) has done on the application of sheaves in network modelling, and exploring how [sheaf neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06333) are used to extend GCNs. Now, I'm more curious if one play off the success sheaves have found in these measurement applications by using Artin stacks to understand better how these measurements change as the underlying system deforms.
 2. **Multi-Scale Modeling**: I stumbled on Gwilliam's work using [factorization algebras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06137) and deformation theory in EFT and it made me really curious about renormalization more broadly. Particularly curious in answering the question of renormalizability in broader systems outside of physics. I've been playing with sequences of Artin stacks for this since it seems to allow us to both frame the progressive filtrations and explore deformations over a space in a similar way to renormalization in EFT.
 3. **Adversarial Systems**: I think just about every adversarial system I've worked on has had some central notion of pathfinding under partial observability. Lately I've been learning about POMDPs to approach this from a more reinforcement learned standpoint. Though, I always have and seemingly always will have a theoretical interest in how sheaves can be used to reconcile these partial observations into one actionable object, similar to their combinatorial use in sensor fusion. 
 4. **Exploit Development**: I'm still very new to this, but I've been learning how to exploit kernel vulnerabilities for privilege escalation and persistence. I've only done one vulnerable driver attack so far for basic admin -> system escalation, but its clear how valuable these can be for rooting persistent malware too, so im hoping to get a working implementation soon of a vulnerable driver based attack for gaining peristent privileged access. For evasion curiosities, I'm starting to explore algebraic methods for polymorphism, this seems to be something that should be possible albeit finicky as heck.
 5. **Adversarial Machine Learning**: My main interest here is in exploring model RE. Model RE has a really interesting framing as a tomography problem that makes me suspect you can take a functional/signal based approach to reverse engineering here based on inputs/outputs. Still feeling my way around the basic tomography aspect first but I also think this suggest there is inherently a potential for geometric methods as well like clifford analysis.
